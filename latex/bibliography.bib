    abstract = {The aim of this work is to present a novel sampling-based numerical scheme designed to solve a certain class of stochastic optimal control problems, utilizing forward and backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). By means of a nonlinear version of the Feynman–Kac lemma, we obtain a probabilistic representation of the solution to the nonlinear Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, expressed in the form of a system of decoupled FBSDEs. This system of FBSDEs can be solved by employing linear regression techniques. The proposed framework relaxes some of the restrictive conditions present in recent sampling based methods within the Linearly Solvable Optimal Control framework, and furthermore addresses problems in which the time horizon is not prespecified. To enhance the efficiency of the proposed scheme when treating more complex nonlinear systems, we then derive an iterative algorithm based on Girsanov’s theorem on the change of measure, which features importance sampling. This scheme is shown to be capable of learning the optimal control without requiring an initial guess.}

    abstract  = {We present a deep recurrent neural network architecture to solve a class of stochastic optimal control problems described by fully nonlinear Hamilton Jacobi Bellman partial differential equations. Such PDEs arise when considering stochastic dynamics characterized by uncertainties that are additive, state dependent, and control multiplicative. Stochastic models with these characteristics are important in computational neuroscience, biology, finance, and aerospace systems and provide a more accurate representation of actuation than models with only additive uncertainty. Previous literature has established the inadequacy of the linear HJB theory for such problems, so instead, methods relying on the generalized version of the Feynman-Kac lemma have been proposed resulting in a system of second-order Forward-Backward SDEs. However, so far, these methods suffer from compounding errors resulting in lack of scalability. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based algorithm that leverages the second-order FBSDE representation and LSTM-based recurrent neural networks to not only solve such stochastic optimal control problems but also overcome the problems faced by traditional approaches, including scalability. The resulting control algorithm is tested on a high-dimensional linear system and three nonlinear systems from robotics and biomechanics in simulation to demonstrate feasibility and out-performance against previous methods.}

    abstract  = {We propose to learn a generative model via entropy interpolation with a Schr{ö}dinger Bridge. The generative learning task can be formulated as interpolating between a reference distribution and a target distribution based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. At the population level, this entropy interpolation is characterized via an SDE on [0,1] with a time-varying drift term. At the sample level, we derive our Schr{ö}dinger Bridge algorithm by plugging the drift term estimated by a deep score estimator and a deep density ratio estimator into the Euler-Maruyama method. Under some mild smoothness assumptions of the target distribution, we prove the consistency of both the score estimator and the density ratio estimator, and then establish the consistency of the proposed Schr{ö}dinger Bridge approach. Our theoretical results guarantee that the distribution learned by our approach converges to the target distribution. Experimental results on multimodal synthetic data and benchmark data support our theoretical findings and indicate that the generative model via Schr{ö}dinger Bridge is comparable with state-of-the-art GANs, suggesting a new formulation of generative learning. We demonstrate its usefulness in image interpolation and image inpainting.}
